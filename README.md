**Update - 20180601**: Any future development will happen on this new fork. Hoping add stability as well as new SOCs. If you are interesrted in joining the [txn2](https://txn2.com) team please email human@txn2.com.

**Update**: Tested and functioning on well on the [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://amzn.to/2jfXhCA) and [Raspberry Pi 3 B](https://amzn.to/2Kq9Doa). Looking to support additional SOCs in upcoming versions. (Disclosure: the Pi links to Amazon are affiliate links, why not?)

**NOTICE**: This project is intended to aid in developing "configure wifi over wifi" solutions for IOT projects using the Raspberry Pi. The main use case for this project is to reproduce functionality common to devices like Nest or Echo, where the user turns on the device, connects to it and configures it for wifi. I have over 800 devices running this software in production and all have had their wifi configured using it. 

**This is not a captive portal project. While I have personaly used it for this, it requires additional networking and can be unstable. I don't support this use and so your millage may vary.**

**txwifi** is only expected to run properly on stock Raspberry Pis and not tested on any other hardware configurations.

IOT Wifi is very small/8MB Docker Container built for the [Raspberry Pi 3](https://amzn.to/2jfXhCA).
IOT Wifi exposes a simple JSON based REST API for controlling the wireless network interface. This container allows the Raspberry Pi to accept wifi connections as an access point (aka AP) while at the same time connecting to an existing wifi network (station mode).

Go (Golang) was used to develop the main application code, to produce a minimal docker image with great performance. The container runs [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) with small, optimized versions of [hostapd], [wpa_supplicant] and [dnsmasq], controlled by the container's API endpoints.

If you have a Raspberry Pi 3 and you want to provide wifi based configuration abilities, all you need is Docker installed and a little over 8MB of free drive space.

TL;DR? If you are not interested in reading all this, you can skip ahead to
[Getting Started](#getting-started).

IOT Wifi is a [Raspberry Pi] wifi management REST service written in [Go] and
intended to run in a [Docker container on a Raspberry Pi](https://hub.docker.com/r/cjimti/iotwifi/).

IOT Wifi sets up network interfaces, runs [hostapd], [wpa_supplicant] and
[dnsmasq] to run simultaneously,  allowing a user (or another service) to connect to the Raspberry Pi via [hostapd]/[dnsmasq] and issue commands that configure and connect [wpa_supplicant] to another [AP]. IOT Wifi then exposes a small web server on the Pi and offers a JSON based REST API to configure Wifi. The IOT Wifi container allows you to build a custom [Captive Portal] web page or even programmatically connect from another device and use the exposed API to configure the target device.

Using wifi to configure a wifi connection is often a standard requirement for [IOT]. As Raspberry Pis are becoming a popular choice as an [IOT] platform, this helps solve the frequent need to manage AP and Station modes.

## Background

Over a year ago I wrote a blog post called [RASPBERRY PI 3 - WIFI STATION+AP] with my notes on setting up a **Raspberry Pi 3** to run as a [Wifi Access Point][AP] (Hotspot) and a [Wifi Client (aka Wifi Station)][Station] simultaneously. This old blog post gets a considerable amount of traffic, so it seems there is quite a bit of interest in this. I have come to realize that some of the steps in my old post have changed since newer versions of [Raspian] (n00bs build) are released.

Since writing the post, I have had a few personal and professional projects
requiring a Raspberry Pi to allow wifi setup **over wifi**. I decided to open
source this simple project to help others with similar requirements as well
as gain some feedback on where and how I can improve it. I would welcome
any contribution and credit any contributors.

## Getting Started

You will need a Raspberry Pi 3, running Raspian Stretch. You
can use the [Noobs] release to install the latest version of Raspian.

### Disable wpa_supplicant on Raspberry Pi

You do not want the default **[wpa_supplicant]** (the software that communicates
with the wifi driver and connects to Wifi networks,) running and competing
with the **IOT Wifi** container.

```bash
# prevent wpa_supplicant from starting on boot
$ sudo systemctl mask wpa_supplicant.service

# rename wpa_supplicant on the host to ensure that it is not
# used.
sudo mv /sbin/wpa_supplicant /sbin/no_wpa_supplicant

# kill any running processes named wpa_supplicant
$ sudo pkill wpa_supplicant
```

### Install Docker on Raspberry Pi

Ssh into the Pi or use the terminal application from the desktop on the Pi
to get a Bash shell.

```bash
# Docker install script
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

![Install Docker](/doc_assets/install_docker.gif)

```bash
# add pi user to Docker user group
$ sudo usermod -aG docker pi
```

![Usermod Docker](/doc_assets/usermod.gif)

Reboot the Pi and test Docker.

```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

After reboot, ensure Docker is installed correctly by running a Hello World
Docker container.

```bash
# run the Docker Hello World container and remove the container
# when finished (the --rm flag)
$ docker run --rm hello-world
```

![Docker Hello World on Raspberry Pi](/doc_assets/docker-hello-world.gif)

### Pull the IOT Wifi Docker Image

You can optionally clone and build the entire project, however, to get
started quickly I'll show you how to use a pre-built Docker Image. At
only 16MB this little image contains everything you need. The image
is based on [Alpine Linux] and contains [hostapd], [wpa_supplicant] and
[dnsmasq], along with a compiled wifi management utility written in go,
the source is found in this repository: https://github.com/txn2/txwifi.

```bash
# Pull the IOT Wifi Docker Image
$ docker pull cjimti/iotwifi
```

![Docker IOT Wifi Image](/doc_assets/docker-pull-image.gif)

### IOT Wifi Configuration

You will need a configuration JSON file. You can download a default as
a template or just it unmodified for testing. You can mount the
configuration file into the container or specify a location with
an environment variable.

Use the default configuration file and location for testing:

```bash
# Download the default configuration file

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txn2/txwifi/master/cfg/wificfg.json

```

![Download Configuration](/doc_assets/download-config.gif)

The default configuration looks like this:

```json
{
    "dnsmasq_cfg": {
      "address": "/#/192.168.27.1",
      "dhcp_range": "192.168.27.100,192.168.27.150,1h",
      "vendor_class": "set:device,IoT"
    },
    "host_apd_cfg": {
       "ip": "192.168.27.1",
       "ssid": "iot-wifi-cfg-3",
       "wpa_passphrase":"iotwifipass",
       "channel": "6"
    },
      "wpa_supplicant_cfg": {
        "cfg_file": "/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf"
    }
}
```

You may want to change the **ssid** (AP/Hotspot Name) and the **wpa_passphrase** to something more appropriate to your needs. However, the defaults are fine for testing.

### Run The IOT Wifi Docker Container

The following `docker run` command will create a running Docker container from
the **[cjimti/iotwifi]** Docker image we pulled in the steps above. The container needs to run in a **privileged mode** and have access to the **host network** (the
Raspberry Pi device) to configure and manage the network interfaces on
the Raspberry Pi. We will also need to mount the configuration file.

We will run it in the foreground to observe the startup process. If you want
it to run the background, you need to remove the `--rm` and pass the `-d` flag. If you want to it restart on reboot or failure, you can pass the flag
`--restart=unless-stopped`. 

[Read more on the `docker run` command.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

```bash
$ docker run --rm --privileged --net host \
      -v $(pwd)/wificfg.json:/cfg/wificfg.json \
      cjimti/iotwifi
```
Optionally, you can also map a directory containing `wpa_supplicant.conf`, like so:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --privileged --net host \
      -v $(pwd)/wificfg.json:/cfg/wificfg.json \
      -v <WPA_SUPPLICANT_HOST_PATH>:<WPA_SUPPLICANT_CONTAINER_PATH> \
      cjimti/iotwifi
```

Where `<WPA_SUPPLICANT_CONTAINER_PATH>` is the path containing `wpa_supplicant.conf` specified in `wificfg.json`.

The IOT Wifi container outputs logs in the JSON format. While this makes
them a bit more challenging to read, we can feed them directly (or indirectly)
into tools like Elastic Search or other databases for alerting or analytics.

You should see some initial JSON objects with messages like `Starting IoT Wifi...`:

```json
{"hostname":"raspberrypi","level":30,"msg":"Starting IoT Wifi...","name":"iotwifi","pid":0,"time":"2018-03-15T20:19:50.374Z","v":0}
```

Keeping the current terminal open, you can log in to another terminal and
take a look the network interfaces on the Raspberry Pi.

```bash
# use ifconfig to view the network interfaces
$ ifconfig
```

You should see a new interface called **uap0**:

```plain
uap0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.27.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.27.255
        inet6 fe80::6e13:d169:b00b:c946  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether b8:27:eb:fe:c8:ab  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 111  bytes 8932 (8.7 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 182  bytes 24416 (23.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

The standard wifi interface **wlan0** should be available, yet unconfigured since we have not yet connected to an external wifi network (access point).

```plain
wlan0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether b8:27:eb:fe:c8:ab  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

### Connect to the Pi over Wifi

On your laptop or phone, you should now see a Wifi Network named **iot-wifi-cfg-3** assuming you did not change it from the default. The default password for this network is **iotwifipass**. Once connected to this network you should get an IP address assigned to the range specified in the config: `192.168.27.100,192.168.27.150,1h`.

![Coeect Phone](/doc_assets/phone.jpg)

Once connected open a web browser and go to http://192.168.27.1:8080/status. You can access this API endpoint on the Raspberry Pi device itself from `localhost`*. On on Pi try the curl command `curl http://localhost:8080/status`.

You should receive a JSON message similar to the following:

```json
{"status":"OK","message":"status","payload":{"address":"b8:27:eb:fe:c8:ab","uuid":"a736659a-ae85-5e03-9754-dd808ea0d7f2","wpa_state":"INACTIVE"}}
```

From now on I'll demonstrate API calls to the new container with the [`curl` command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) on the device. If you were developing a Captive Portal or configuration web page, you could translate these calls into Javascript and control the device Wifi with AJAX.

> You can use my simple static web server IOT Web container for hosting a Captive Portal or configuration web page. See https://github.com/cjimti/iotweb.

To get a list of Wifi Networks the device can see, issue a call to the **scan** endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/scan
```

### Connect the Pi to a Wifi Network

The device can connect to any network it can see. After running a network scan  `curl http://localhost:8080/scan` you can choose a network and post the login credentials to IOT Web.

```bash
# post wifi credentials
$ curl -w "\n" -d '{"ssid":"home-network", "psk":"mystrongpassword"}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST localhost:8080/connect
```
You should get a JSON response message after a few seconds. If everything went well you will see something like the following:

```json
{"status":"OK","message":"Connection","payload":{"ssid":"straylight-g","state":"COMPLETED","ip":"","message":""}}
```

You can get the status at any time with the following call to the **status** endpoint. Here is an example:

```bash
# get the wifi status
$ curl -w "\n" http://localhost:8080/status
```

Sample return JSON:

```json
{"status":"OK","message":"status","payload":{"address":"b7:26:ab:fa:c9:a4","bssid":"50:3b:cb:c8:d3:cd","freq":"2437","group_cipher":"CCMP","id":"0","ip_address":"192.168.86.116","key_mgmt":"WPA2-PSK","mode":"station","p2p_device_address":"fa:27:eb:fe:c9:ab","pairwise_cipher":"CCMP","ssid":"straylight-g","uuid":"a736659a-ae85-5e03-9754-dd808ea0d7f2","wpa_state":"COMPLETED"}}
```

### Check the network interface status

The **wlan0** is now a client on a wifi network. In this case, it received the IP address 192.168.86.116. We can check the status of **wlan0** with `ifconfig`*

```bash
# check the status of wlan0 (wireless interface)
$ ifconfig wlan0
```

Example return.

```plain
wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.86.116  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.86.255
        inet6 fe80::9988:beab:290e:a6af  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether b8:27:eb:fe:c8:ab  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 547  bytes 68641 (67.0 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 36  bytes 6025 (5.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

We can also check the connection by issuing a **ping** command from the
device and specify the network interface to use:

```bash
# ping out from the wlan0 interface
$ ping -I wlan0 8.8.8.8
```

Hit Control-C to stop the ping and get calculations.

```plain
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) from 192.168.86.116 wlan0: 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=20.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=57 time=23.4 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=57 time=16.0 ms
^C
--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 16.075/20.138/23.422/3.049 ms
```

### Conclusion

Wrapping the all complexity of wifi management into a small Docker
container, accessible over a web-based REST API reduces the dependencies on the device to only require Docker.

There are many ways to handle security using middleware or IP tables. A separate container can also manage security.

Check out the project [IOT Web](https://github.com/cjimti/iotweb) to get
started with tiny a static web container suitable for building user interfaces for wifi management or captive portals.

Submit a Github issue or pull request if there are features or bug fixes you would like added to the project.
